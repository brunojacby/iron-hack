### Get Started

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

Run ```npm install && npm start``` in the app directory.

### Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Bootstrap (latest)
- Firebase (Database and User Authentication)

### Task 1

The users are able to sign up but the sign in functionality is pending. Make sure  potential candidates can log into the app and are redirected to the careers page.

### Task 2

If the user has already completed their profile, the form must be filled in with that information and the button should say “Update profile”.


### Task 3

When the open positions are displayed, the “Apply” button should be disabled if the user is not logged in or if it has already applied.


### Task 4

The users should be able to apply to a position. After that, the “Apply” button should be disabled.


### Bonus

It would be great if you can improve the user experience.
